        <h3>AN UNHEARD STORY:</h3>
                    One of the most remarkable examples of Gorkha soldiers' bravery is that of<strong> Naik Jadunath Singh </strong> of the<strong>Gorkha Rifles</strong> during the <strong>Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.</strong> 

                    <div>
                   <p><strong>Naik Jadunath Singh </strong> displayed exceptional courage and selflessness in the  <strong>Battle of Dograi </strong> near <strong>Lahore</strong>, which earned him the <strong>Param Vir Chakra</strong>, India's highest military honor for bravery in the face of the enemy.</p>

<div class="common-box">
    <strong>Here is a summary of his heroism:</strong><br>
    <p>In September 1965, during a fierce battle against Pakistani forces, Naik Jadunath Singh's platoon was tasked with capturing a vital enemy position. The platoon came under heavy artillery and machine gun fire, but despite the intense opposition, Naik Singh charged forward, leading his men with extraordinary resolve.
        He was severely wounded during the assault but continued to push forward, determined to complete the mission. Even after being injured, he carried out his task with relentless courage. His actions helped the Indian Army secure the position, and he became a symbol of indomitable spirit and bravery.
        Naik Jadunath Singh's display of grit and determination under fire is a shining example of the valor and fearlessness for which Gorkha soldiers are famous. His bravery continues to inspire generations of soldiers in India.
