        <h3>EARLY HISTORY</h3>
        <ul class="districts">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ANCIENT TIMES:</strong>  The region of Sikkim has been inhabited by various Tibetan and Bhutanese communities for centuries. It was traditionally ruled by local chiefs and tribes.</li>
                    <li><strong>KINGDOM FORMATION (1642): </strong>The Kingdom of Sikkim was established in 1642 when Phuntsog Namgyal, the first Chogyal (king), ascended to the throne. The Namgyal dynasty ruled the region for several centuries. The Chogyals were considered spiritual and temporal rulers, with close ties to Tibetan Buddhism.]</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="common-box">
        <h2>Relationship with Tibet</h2>
        <ul class="districts">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tibetan Influence:</strong> Sikkim had strong cultural, religious, and political ties with Tibet throughout its early history. The Chogyals maintained close relations with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and often sought the spiritual guidance of Tibetan lamas.</li>
                    <li><strong>British Involvement (19th Century): </strong>During British colonial rule, Sikkim's strategic location between India, Nepal, and Tibet attracted British interest. In 1817, the British East India Company made Sikkim a protectorate, marking the beginning of British influence in the region.]</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>British Protectorate</h2>
        <ul class="districts">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Treaty of Titalia (1861):</strong> The British formalized their relationship with Sikkim through the Treaty of Titalia, which recognized Sikkim as a British protectorate. British India had control over Sikkim's foreign relations, defense, and communications, but the kingdom remained internally autonomous.</li>
                    <li><strong> Sikkim's Struggles:</strong>: Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sikkim struggled with internal power struggles,
                        disputes with neighboring Nepal and Bhutan, and challenges to the monarchy’s authority.]</li>

    <h2>India’s Influence Post-Independence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Sikkim as a Protectorate of India (1950):</strong> : After India gained independence in 1947, Sikkim maintained its status as a protectorate under a treaty with India, though it still retained its monarchic government and internal autonomy.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Political Unrest:</strong> In the 1960s and early 1970s, growing dissatisfaction among the ethnic Nepali majority, who sought greater political representation and integration with India, led to protests and political instability.]</li>

    <h2>Integration into India</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Historical Background:</strong> : Sikkim was an independent kingdom with close ties to both India and Tibet. It was a protectorate of Britain under the British Raj, and after India's independence in 1947, Sikkim was initially an independent kingdom with a special relationship with India.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Independence Period:</strong>: After India gained independence, Sikkim maintained its status as a protectorate of India under a treaty signed in 1950. This treaty provided India with control over Sikkim’s defense, foreign relations, and communications, though Sikkim retained internal autonomy.</li>

                <li><strong>Political Instability and Desire for Change:</strong> In the 1960s, political unrest and dissatisfaction with the monarchy in
                    Sikkim grew, especially among the ethnic Nepali majority. There were calls for greater representation, democratic reforms, and integration with India. The popular movement for democratic rights was supported by India.
                    </li>
                <li><strong>India’s Support for Integration:</strong> In 1973, India played a crucial role in resolving the political instability in Sikkim, helping to install a pro-India government. The new government, headed by Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal's cousin, Palden Lhamo, accepted the idea of closer integration with India.</li>
                <li><strong>Sikkim’s Accession to India:</strong> On May 16, 1975, after a series of political changes, the Sikkimese monarchy was
                    abolished following a referendum. The people of Sikkim voted overwhelmingly (97.5%) in favor of joining India. On May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of India.
                    .</li>

                <li> Thus, Sikkim’s integration into India was a combination of diplomatic negotiations, local political movements, and the support of the Indian government.</li>
